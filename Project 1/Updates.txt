12/09 - Added Stretched sphere to top; depth buffer acting odd
14/09, 14:31 - Fixed depth buffer
15/09, 18:30 - Added boosters, trying to figure out how to draw multiple ships
15/09, 21:06 - Draws 16 ships in a grid, simple lighting

9/17:
Implemented camera controls for the current project
The controls should not interfer with the existing code in anyway
Added a few global variables for camera control
Small changes to the orientation of the initial camera, can be edited
Implemented a zoom in/out option with PageUp and PageDown, ranges created to keep the zoom level in check, possible extra credit =D

9/18 - Changed the method of drawing the ships, using a Display List now
9/21 - Fins are now drawn

9/23:
Second window up, camera controls fixed for both windows
some maintenance 

9/24:
Second window displaying orthogonal view from z axis
The spaceships do need to be arranged in a square-rhombus pattern as opposed to a square
Code in InitializeGL and been changed to reflect this
additional maintenance
edits to both spaceship.h and spaceship.cpp to allow for multiple displaylists of spaceships
NOTE: A standard orthogonal display of the spaceship does not produce the desired viewing effects.
      The spaceships displayed appear extremely close together and overlap with eachother. 
      It would be unreasonable to space the spaceships further apart than already is
      Possible solution: create a "fake" range of 7 spaceships representing orthogonal view. 
      Will consult Perry when I get a chance 

9/25:
Updated the zooming function. Zoom now operates correctly as according to example by increasing/decreasing the fov instead of the camera radius

9/26:
Background grid for the camera in third person view now up and running. Grid is drawn as a wiresphere in the distance.

9/29 - Everything is up and running, boy!!

9/30 - 3:25p - First round of some commenting
9/30 - 4:35p - Potentially added code to delete DisplayLists at program close
9/30: - 5:02 - Got rid of warnings (type conversion issues)
9/30 - 6:26p - Fixed z fighting issues on spaceship object
9/30 - 7:16p - Reordered functions in main to be more "chronological"
9/30 - 9:20p - "fpvWindowClosed" and "tpvWindowClosed" merged into one boolean, "WindowClosed"

10/1 - 11:54a - added better commenting on text, Spaceship::initialize(); Added dynamic resizing functionality on text

10/1 - 7:47p - removed dynamic text resizing, have code for frustum control in there, but not active
10/1 - 7:58p - tweaked the colors of the ship
10/1 - 8:03p - re-added frustum control (why not?)
10/1 - 10:57p - MOUSE MOVEMENT
